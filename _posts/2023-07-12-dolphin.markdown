Data Sheep 🐑 and Cloud Dolphin 🐬 would occasionally meet during their respective endeavors, with the dolphin appearing at the river's edge and Data Sheep 🐑 grazing nearby. However, their interactions were limited due to their differing habitats and the challenges posed by their distinct time zones. The sheep 🐑 would be awake during the day ☀️, while the dolphin 🐬 would come to life in the moonlit nights 🌙.
